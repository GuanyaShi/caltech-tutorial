    "# Installation instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are new to Python or simply want a pain-free experience, I recommend you install the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)) distribution. It comes with all you need shipped-in and ready to use!\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have anaconda installed, you want to get either the [Jupyter Lab](http://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), or the [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/install.html). Typically, you can simply run:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda install jupyterlab\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For PyTorch, simply follow the [instructions](https://pytorch.org/). With conda, it should be something like:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda install pytorch torchvision -c pytorch\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, to install TensorLy to get the latest version, you can clone the Github repository. In the command line, run:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/tensorly/tensorly\n",
    "cd tensorly\n",
    "pip install -e .\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Or, if you have an issue during installation, you can also use conda:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda install -c tensorly tensorly\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you can install Scikit-Learn using pip. In the command line, just type:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install scikit-learn\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "# Checking whether you have the correct versions\n",
    "First, open a jupyter lab (just type jupyter lab in the command line and open the link that appears) . You can also run the code directly in Python or IPython but it's not as nice. Generally, if you are not already familiar with jupyter lab or jupyter notebook, I recommend you spend a little time exploring as it's a very useful tool, especially for data science.\n",
    "\n",
    "To check you have all you need, you can run the following:"
